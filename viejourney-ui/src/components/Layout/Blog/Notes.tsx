        Renting a car for Day 2-4 is a must. Driving is a bit difficult and
        roads have lots of potholes so try to use toll roads when possible and
        be alert when driving. Pack lots of sunscreen and buy water bottles or
        get from hotel. Find a hotel with breakfast included! Saved so much
        hassle and a big meal prepared us for the day! Street side parking in
        the San Juan Condado area is a challenge, but still possible. Park where
        curb is painted white, yellow is reserved for taxis. When filling gas
        youâ€™ll have to go inside and pay for the pump and fill up to a certain
        amount. Gas is posted in liters, and usually is about $2.86/gal.
